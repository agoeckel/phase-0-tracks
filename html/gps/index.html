<!--Purpose of HTML5 semantic tags/Which ones are most useful?

  The purpose of HTML5 semantic tags is to specify and format your pages information. They are extremely useful in that they contain content that then can be selected and prioritized in specific ways to make content render accordingly. The ones that I see as the most useful would be the body, head, and main content tags because they hold the key information. From there I would say that the selection tag is quite useful, as well as the div tag. -->

  <!-- What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?

  The order in which the browser uses to display elements on a page is top down. From my understanding it is actually rendered in a tree like manner and has a very close relation to the actual html source code. -->

<!-- What did you learn about sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?

I learned exactly how to create a snippet and how to set the tab trigger as well as the source format. They are extremely handy and I do see myself creating more snippets in the future. For now I am going to practice typing in frameworks manually until I am completely comfortable with framework practices. -->

<!-- What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?

The concept that was most difficult for me in this challenge was building out the table structure. I found myself having to look up the tags to refresh my memory and also running into small structure errors. I will study tables more and continue to practice them to establish muscle memory. -->
