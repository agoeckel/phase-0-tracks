# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* _Version control_ is a way of "saving" or rather committing, every change made to code in order to prevent conflicts and issues when trying to build additional features.

* A _branch_ is a small chunk of code to add to the "master" part of the repo slowly over time. You work in branches in order to not destroy the part of your code that is fundamental and works properly.

* A _commit_ is the same thing as saving your code. This is good practice to do on a regular basis.

* A _merge conflict_ is when you try to merge new code into your current working files and something is incorrectly labeled or the new changes are incompatible.
